## Hardware description

The main goal of our project was to study the use of given components and create a common system.

In this project, we used:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Joy-stick (2 ADC channels, 1 push button)
3. Rotary encoder (2 digital channels, 1 push button)
4. Digilent PmodCLP LCD module
5. LED
6. Resistor (around 150 ohm)

The Arduino served as the core of the project. The joystick moves the cursor/symbol on the LCD display size 16x2. By turning the encoder, the user can select different symbol from the ASCII table. It is worth noting that when choosing symbols, there are no custom symbols that are initially empty. When you press the enecoder button, the value of the symbol is returned to the beginning of the list for convenience, i.e. to the symbol `!`. When you press the joystick button, the value of this given character will appear on the screen, in our case it is the character `0xef`. Also in the project was used LED with a resistor to indicate the operation of the ADC conversion.

## Software description

The main function code was 280 lines. The entire program used 171 bytes (8.3%) of RAM and 1818 bytes (5.6%) of Flash.

In this project, libraries were used that were previously used in past labs. These are libraries `LCD` for working with a display, an `UART` library for displaying parameters in the console, a `GPIO` library for signal processing on pins, and a `timer.h`. All the work of our project is in the `main.c` file.

After assigning all the pins used, defining global constants, as well as connecting all the necessary libraries, the main function follows. In the main function, the pin mode is assigned as input or output, then the register for ADC conversion is also assigned, Timer1 is turned on with a prescaler of 33 ms, as well as an interrupt. At the end, the program ends with an endless loop, where the functions `ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)` and `ISR(ADC_vect)` are processed.

In function `ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)`, first of all, ADC conversion for the joystick is started, then there is a part that processes the values from the encoder. In the `main.c` function, the initial value of the `pinALast` encoder was written, which we later compare with the output data. If the signal changes from pin A come first, then we are moving clockwise, if from B, then against. With each movement of the encoder, we increase or decrease the `symbol` value, which is subsequently displayed on the LCD. If the encoder button is pressed, the `symbol` value is changed to the first value, in our case it is `!`.

In function `ISR(ADC_vect)`, you first need to display a symbol, which we will change later. This was implemented with a `marker` that changes to a value that will never be reached, so this condition will only be processed once at the start of the program.
Next, it processes the ADC conversion of two channels in turn using the `switch...case` condition. First, the stream from the ADC0 channel is configured (value `ADMUX = 0b01000000`), then ADC conversion takes place. The joystick sends two analog signals ranging from `0` to `1024`. When the joystick is in neutral position, these parameters are approximately `511`. In this way, we can determine the direction along the axis. By changing the ADC conversion channels, we change the direction of the x, y coordinate axes. At the end of each case condition, the next channel (AD2, `ADMUX = 0b01000001`) is configured. This way we can control more analog pins. When driving, the symbol on the display should not go beyond the LCD display (16x2). For this, a condition was set up when, when increasing the value of `line` 16 and higher, the cursor returned to the corner position. When moving to the left, this value is 255 because the type of the variable is `uint8_t`. Each ADC conversion processing is accompanied by a blinking LED for clarity. Also, the position of the cursor is written out in the internal terminal by `UART`.
